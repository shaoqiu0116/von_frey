Mechanosensitivity can be determined as the threshold amount of force required to elicit a behavioral response, such as the withdrawal of a paw from the applied stimulus. There are different methods available to estimate paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) with the use of von Frey filaments, but the up-down method of Dixon as applied to rodents by Chaplan et al. remains one of the most commonly used.

At the end of the trial the paw withdrawal estimate (PWT) is calculated by taking the value of the final filament used and adding an adjustment factor derived from the response pattern using the calculations of Dixon.
